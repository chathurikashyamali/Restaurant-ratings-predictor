# 🍽️ Restaurant Ratings Predictor

This project involves building a **machine learning model** to predict restaurant ratings based on various features such as **location, cuisines, cost, and delivery options**. A **Streamlit** web app was also developed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.

## 🚀 Overview

- 📊 Predicts restaurant ratings using real-world data
- 🤖 Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models
- 🌳 **Decision Tree Regression** provided the best performance
- 🧪 Cleaned and preprocessed data with features like:
  - Location
  - Cuisines
  - Cost for two
  - Online delivery
  - Table booking
- 🖥️ Built a **Streamlit** web app for interactive predictions
